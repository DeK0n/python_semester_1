#1
# Write a function that returns a random dice roll between 1 and 6. The function should not have any parameters.
# Write a main program that rolls the dice until the result is 6. The main program should print out the result of each roll.

#2
# Modify the function above so that it gets the number of sides on the dice as a parameter.
# With the modified function you can for example roll a 21-sided role-playing dice. 
# The difference to the last exercise is that the dice rolling in the main program continues 
# until the program gets the maximum number on the dice, which is asked from the user at the beginning.

#3
# Write a function that gets the quantity of gasoline in American gallons and returns the number converted to litres. 
# Write a main program that asks for a volume in gallons from the user and converts the value to liters. 
# The conversion must be done by using the function. Conversions continue until the user inputs a negative value.

#4
# Write a function that gets a list of integers as a parameter. The function returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. 
# For testing, write a main program where you create a list, call the function, and print out the value it returned.

#5
# Write a function that gets a list of integers as a parameter. The function returns a second list that is otherwise the same as 
# the original list except that all uneven numbers have been removed. For testing, write a main program where you create a list,
#  call the function, and then print out both the original as well as the cut-down list.

#6
# Write a function that receives two parameters: the diameter of a round pizza in centimeters and the price of the pizza in euros. 
# The function calculates and returns the unit price of the pizza per square meter. The main program asks the user to enter 
# the diameter and price of two pizzas and tells the user which pizza provides better value for money (which of them has a lower unit price).
# You must use the function you wrote for calculating the unit prices.
